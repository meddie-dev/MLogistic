            Vehicles are used to transport goods from one point to another in a constrained time frame with zero damage to goods. Different vehicles have different capacities in terms of weight, size, and quantity of goods. There are various types of vehicles used in the logistics industry. Selection of a vehicle in the logistics industry is characterized by the type and quantity of goods to be transported. Vehicle selection is a very critical decision, as underutilization increases operating costs and reduces profit margins.
